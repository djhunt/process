Community Oriented Budgeting Recommendation
*******************************************

The TAC recommends the Board adopt the following Community Oriented Budgeting
process.

Goals
-----

Currently LFN contains a number of large projects with a need to conduct
outreach, hold developer and marketing events and other community activities
addressed by this discretionary budget.

Handling of Tungsten Fabric (TF)
--------------------------------
Tungsten Fabric having being admitted to LFN is also in need of these
funds to reach its goals of diversifying the community and reaching additional
pools of developers as well as addressing the needs of its current development
community. It will take a substantial time for TF to move through the necessary
reviews to become a TAC project and it may fail in its diversity and outreach
goals without funds. We propose that for the budget needs we consider the pool
to be TAC projects plus TF, with the budget process below also applying to TF.


Normal Budget Process
---------------------
1. **Budget:** The Board budgets an amount for the year equal to some factor
   greater than one times the amount allocated by LFN to General and
   Administrative (G&A) funds, to be divided equally among the TSCs of the
   TAC projects for them to spend at their discretion in support of:

   a. Community events - Community events colocated at existing conferences
      as meets the communities needs as determined by each projects TSC.
   b. Marketing in support of those colocated events, including booth
      collateral (booth at broader event at which community event is
      collocated, signs, swag, handouts, food, video, support staff and their
      travel, food, event promotion, etc).
   c. Other community needs as they arise.
   d. This does not include common costs like infrastructure, salaries of
      staff, interns, etc which should continue to be handled centrally by the
      Board.
   e. This does not include large standalone conferences/summits.

2. **Notify:** Expenditures by the TSCs of the TAC project must be
   presented to the TAC as a notification prior to being made.

   a. The TSC notification of the TAC is intended to discover possible
      synergies with other projects, in the hope that projects may find
      opportunities to increase value or reduce costs by collaborating on
      expenditures.
   b. Only the Projects can adequately assess whether there is a synergy.
      The TAC presentation is a notification process, not an approval
      process.
   c. The decision to collaborate or not belongs to the individual TSCs of
      the TAC projects choosing to collaborate to insure true benefit
      to all communities involved in the collaboration.

3. **Expend:** A project's TSC may proceed with the planned expenditure two
   weeks after TAC notification of the expenditure. A project's TSC may, at
   its discretion, delay the expenditure to work jointly with another
   community or to allow additional conversation.

4. **Report:** The TSCs of the TAC projects report to the Board
   quarterly their expenditures for the past quarter, why they were made,
   and what benefits were realized.

The Normal Budget Process in this proposal was informed by the `response of the
Board`_ to the TAC's previous recommendation on community representation that
it would consider budgeting fund to the individual project TSCs to be spent at
their discretion.

Exceptional Budget Process
--------------------------

In the event that one or more TSCs, individually or jointly, identify a budget
item need that cannot be adequately addressed by the discretionary funds
delegated to the TSCs of the TAC Projects, that need should be
addressed by this Exceptional Budget Process.

1. One or more of the TSCs of TAC Projects must prepare a Budget
   Request to the Board.
2. Budget Requests must be presented to the TAC as a notification prior
   to forwarding to the Finance Committee of the Board. The TSC presentation
   of a Budget Request to the TAC is intended to discover possible synergies
   with other projects, in the hope of inspiring a joint Budget Request.
3. Only the Projects can adequately assess whether there is a synergy. The TAC
   presentation is a discovery process, not an approval process.
4. Once a Budget Request has been presented to the TAC, it may be forwarded to
   the Finance Committee for consideration.

We recommend a form with the following items for Exceptional Budget Proposals:

1. Title
2. Description
3. Sponsoring community or communities
4. Requested budget amount (please include details on how arrived at budget
   amount)
5. Is this a one time or ongoing expense? If ongoing, please include details
   on cost and timeframe.
6. Timeframe when the resource is needed (including start/end dates if
   applicable)
7. Benefits to communities
8. Impact of budget request being denied
9. Date TAC was notified of Budget Request (links to email threads,
   code reviews of proposal, or meeting minutes)

The Exceptional Budget Process in this proposal is predicated on the
assumption that the A&P Committee is the appropriate point to address these
requests, and that they will carry out whatever internal process the Board
deems reasonable in response.

Other Non-TAC Projects
--------------------------------
Non-TAC Projects should have access to the Exceptional Budget Process. The
Board should consider allocating a small separate budget pool for direct
funding of Non-TAC projects, based on their size and bugdet needs.

Future Updates to the Budget Recommendations
--------------------------------------------
This document should be revised upon admission of new Non-TAC projects beyond
existing set as well as promotion of new projects to the TAC status as part of
the LF-N admissions review and TAC admissions review process to accomodate the
evolving needs of the projects.
