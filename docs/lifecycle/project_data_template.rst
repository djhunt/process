*********************
Project Data Template
*********************

Instructions
------------

This document is a template to collect the data LFN thinks are relevant to LFN
Project health. Projects will copy this template and instantiate it with their
data as a part applying for lifecycle state transitions.

  mkdir -p <relevant lifecycle transition dir>/<project name>/
  cp project_data_template.rst !$/project_data.rst

If the project has instantiated this template before they are welcome to start
from that base and update it with any new information. Be sure that the data
requested by the primary copy of the Project Data Template has not changed.

These instructions should be removed from the instantiated template.

Vocabulary Reference
--------------------

Explanations of domain-specific vocabulary.

.. todo:: Look into using special rst to make these definitions into tooltips
.. todo:: Consider extracting this to a stand-along file so can reuse elsewhere

* Active

  * In this context, typically related to the activity level of a project or
    person.
  * As a person: "Foo Committer on Bar Project has not sent any patches or done
    any code review for Bar in the last 12 months. Bar's Project Lead reached
    out to Foo Committer to discuss transitioning to an Emeritus Committer."
  * As a project: "Bar Project has not had any non-trivial code changes merged
    in the last 12 months. The LFN TAC reached out to Bar Project to discuss
    transitioning to the LFN Archived lifecycle state."
  * The LFN norm for "active" is about 12 months.

* Committer

  * Person with permission to cause commits to be merged into a project's
    source control repositories.

* Contributor

  * Person who has contributed to a project. "Contributions" are broadly
    defined. Examples include things like code, documentation, and bug tracker
    changes.

* Diverse

  * In this context, typically related to the number of different organizations
    involved in a project.

* Downstream

  * In this context, typically means the products based on a project.
    Community collaborates on upstream project, which is downstreamed by a
    company into a product.
  * Alternatively, could relate to a relationship between two "upstream" open
    source projects (not by-company products) where one consumes (is downstream
    of) the other.
  * As a verb: "to copy something from the open source project to a product
    based on it".
  * As a dependency relationship: "Linux is a downstream of C".

* Upstream

  * In this context, typically means the main open source project a community
    collaborates on. The code, tooling and people that comprise a project.
  * As a verb: "to add something to the main open source project".
  * As a dependency relationship: "C is an upstream of Linux".
