1) **Mission and Scope of the LF Networking Fund.**

   a) The primary mission (the "Mission") of the LF Networking Fund (the
      "Directed Fund") is to raise, budget and spend funds and coordinate
      support for open source and/or open specification projects involved with
      the movement or communication of data on a network (including, but not
      limited to, data plane, control plane, analytics, orchestration, and
      automation technologies for enterprise, cloud, and carrier networks,
      collectively the "Scope") in accordance with the provisions of this
      Charter. The projects supported by the Directed Fund will be referred to
      herein as each a "Technical Project" and collectively as the "Technical
      Projects". The governance of each Technical Project is as set forth in
      the applicable charter for each Technical Project.
   b) The Directed Fund supports the Technical Projects. The Directed Fund
      operates under the guidance of the Governing Board of the Directed Fund
      (the "Governing Board") and The Linux Foundation (the "LF") as may be
      consistent with The Linux Foundation’s tax-exempt status.
   c) The Governing Board manages the Directed Fund. The Directed Fund will
      also have a Marketing Advisory Council (“MAC”), a Legal Committee, a
      Finance Committee, Technical Advisory Council (“TAC”) and other
      working groups, councils, committees and similar bodies that may be
      established by the Governing Board (collectively, “Committees”).
      Committees report to the Governing Board.

2) **Membership.**

   a) The Directed Fund will be composed of Platinum Members, Gold Members,
      Silver Members and Associate Members (collectively, “Members”). All
      Members must be current members of the LF (at any level) in good standing
      to participate in the Directed Fund as a member. All participants in the
      Directed Fund, enjoy the privileges and undertake the obligations
      described in this Charter, as from time to time amended by the Governing
      Board with the approval of the LF. During the term of their membership,
      all members will comply with all such policies as the LF Board of
      Directors and/or the Directed Fund may adopt with notice to members.
   b) There will be a maximum of 26 Platinum Members (the “Platinum Cap”),
      which can be raised by vote of the Governing Board.
   c) In addition to the other rights set forth in this Charter, Platinum
      Members will each:

      representative to the Governing Board for every three Gold Members up to
      a maximum of three representatives, provided that so long as there is at
      least one Gold Member there will always be at least one Gold Member
      representative, even if there are less than three Gold Members.

      will each:

      i) be entitled to appoint a voting representative to the MAC;
      ii) enjoy prominent placement in displays of membership logos; and
      iii) have priority for available Platinum Memberships based on the
           seniority of the date the Gold Member joined the Directed Fund as a
           Gold Member.

   f) In addition to the other rights set forth in this Charter:

      i) each Silver Member will be entitled to appoint one non-voting
         representative to the MAC;
      ii) the Silver Members, acting as a class, will be entitled to elect
          annually one representative to the Governing Board, with the
          Governing Board determining the election process; and
      iii) each Silver Member will enjoy placement in displays of Silver
           membership logos.

   g) The Associate Member category of membership is limited to Associate
      Members of The Linux Foundation and acceptance as an Associate Member

      additional criteria for joining the Directed Fund as an Associate Member,

8) **Voting**

   a) Quorum for Governing Board and Committee meetings will require fifty
      percent (50%) of the voting representatives of the Governing Board or
      Committee, as applicable. The Governing Board or Committee may continue
      to meet even if quorum is not met, but will be prevented from making any
      decisions at the meeting. If any representative, without sending an
      alternate, misses any two consecutive Governing Board or Committee
      meetings, as applicable, such representative shall not be counted for
      quorum purposes until she or he next attends. If any elected
      representative, without sending an alternate, misses any three
      consecutive Governing Board or Committee meetings, the Governing Board
      or Committee, as applicable, may call for a new election for such
      election position by a simple majority vote.
   b) Ideally decisions will be made based on consensus. If, however, any
      decision requires a vote to move forward, the representatives of the
      Governing Board or Committee, as applicable, will vote on a one vote per
      voting representative basis.
   c) Except as provided in Sections 8.a. and 17.a., decisions by vote at a
      meeting will require a two-third’s vote, provided quorum is met.
      Except as provided in Section 17.a., decisions by electronic vote
      without a meeting will require a majority of all voting
      representatives of the Governing Board or Committee, as appropriate.
   d) In the event of a tied vote with respect to an action that cannot be
      resolved by the Governing Board, the Chair may refer the matter to the
      LF for assistance in reaching a decision. If there is a tied vote in any
      Committee that cannot be resolved, the matter may be referred to the
      Governing Board.

          is controlled by a Member or which, together with a Member, is under
          the common control of a third party, in each case where such control
          results from ownership, either directly or indirectly, of more than
          fifty percent of the voting securities or membership interests of the

   c) If a Member is itself a foundation, association, consortium, open source
      project, membership organization, user group or other entity that has
      members or sponsors, then the rights and privileges granted to such
