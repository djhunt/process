The TAC acknowledges and accepts the Board's request for a May 4 completion
date on technical governance. Unfortunately, such an ambitious date is
incompatible with drafting the quality governance we are certain the Board is
requesting for the new umbrella-of-umbrellaâ€™s situation we find ourselves in.

In an attempt to meet the Board's request, drafting has been proceeding in
earnest, resulting thus far in documenting of a first draft statement of
principles to guide us [0], a first draft general framework to set the stage
[1], and an incomplete project lifecycle [2]. None of these has achieved full
consensus nor is complete at this time. Neither have these three efforts been
harmonized into a coherent whole. Once we have a fairly presentable set of
proposals, we need to bring them to the LFN communities to solicit additional
feedback and build community buy-in. We are making good progress, but have much
yet to do. See the TODOs inline for details about what still needs to be done.

Had we anticipated that the Board would augment our previous recommendation by
attaching a deadline, we would have provided the baselining from other
communities we provide here.

OpenDaylight's drafting of technical governance took nine weeks, including an
intensive F2F meeting. FD.io's took 5 weeks including a F2F meeting. ONAP's
took 5 weeks including a F2F meeting. Both ONAP and FD.io benefited from
being able to start from the OpenDaylight governance, as their structures were
similar.

LFN's structure is new and novel and so we expect it to be an effort closer to
that of the OpenDaylight drafting, but without the benefit of a F2F. As such
we request the Board extend its deadline to be July 11th for the drafting of
quality technical governance for LFN.
